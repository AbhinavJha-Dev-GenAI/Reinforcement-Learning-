## ðŸ“š What You'll Learn
Learning by doingâ€”agents that optimize behavior based on rewards.

### Core Topics
- âœ… **MDP**: Markov Decision Processes
- âœ… **Q-Learning/DQN**: Value-based learning
- âœ… **Policy Gradients**: PPO, A3C, TRPO
- âœ… **Reward Engineering**: Designing the "incentive" structure

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Path
1. **Classical RL**: Understand states, actions, and the Bellman equation.
2. **Deep RL**: Combine neural networks with Q-learning.
3. **Advanced Policy Gradients**: Learn modern standards like PPO.
4. **Environments**: Build and use Gymnasium/OpenAI Gym environments.
